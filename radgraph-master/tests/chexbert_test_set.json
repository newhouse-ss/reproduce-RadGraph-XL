  "4028": "The left lung is relatively well aerated and clear.  The right\n hemithorax is markedly opacified with volume loss, circumferential pleural\n thickening and pleural fluid with near complete opacification of the right\n lung with right basal pleural catheter noted. Hydropneumothorax previously\n seen is not as well evaluated on this not fully upright film. Cardiac contours\n are somewhat obscured but unremarkable.",
  "4122": "PA and lateral chest compared to ___:\n \n Right upper lobe pneumonia continues to clear.  Tiny right pleural effusion is\n smaller.  Hyperinflation indicates COPD.  Heart size normal.  Right apical\n pleural scarring unchanged.",
  "4161": "PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___:\n \n The contour of the elevated right hemidiaphragm and adjacent pleural\n thickening are unchanged since ___ following removal of the short\n right pleural drainage catheter.  Region of atelectasis at the right lung base\n is best appreciated on the lateral view.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart\n size is normal.  There is no pneumothorax or definite increase in right\n pleural fluid volume.",
  "4226": "Essentially unchanged right paramediastinal fibrosis with a loculated right\n lower lobe effusion.\n                                                                       \n\n         THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.",

  "4406": "The patient had left lower lobe lobectomy in ___.  Expected stable\n surgical changes are seen in the left lung with volume loss and mild pleural\n thickening.  There is no pneumothorax.  The right lung is unremarkable. \n Mediastinal and cardiac contours are not enlarged.",
  "4425": "As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant\n change.  No new parenchymal opacity.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and\n unchanged position and course of the sternal wires and clips after CABG.  The\n pre-existing platelike atelectasis in the left mid lung has resolved. \n Unchanged area of mild right lateral pleural thickening.  No pulmonary edema. \n No pleural effusions.  No lung nodules or masses.",
